# HiBid Enhancer Suite

A Tampermonkey userscript that turns a HiBid lot page into a decision.

It reads the lot's own description, finds what the item actually costs new in
Canada, parses the auction's fee schedule out of its terms, and tells you the
highest hammer price that still beats retail after **buyer's premium + handling
fees + HST**. It shouts at you when a lot is a bad deal, and shouts louder when
the lot is broken.

## What it does on a lot detail page

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Product identification** | Extracts the real product name from the lot description, stripping the `Retail $328.00 \|` prefix, the `****` separator and the auctioneer's `Notes:` block. Builds a tight search query (`Sony WF-1000XM5`), keeping capacity where it moves price (`CORSAIR Vengeance DDR5 32GB`). |
| **Live retail price** | A **Retail (live)** row is injected directly beneath the auctioneer's **Estimate** row, with the price, the matched product title, a condition badge, and deep links — including a CamelCamelCamel price-history link for the exact ASIN. |
| **Fee-aware bid ceiling** | A **Bid guidance** row shows `BID UP TO $X` — the highest hammer price whose all-in cost still clears your target discount — rounded down to a bid the site will actually accept. |
| **Red bad-deal banner** | If the next required bid lands less than 25% under retail, a red box goes to the top of the page with the all-in cost, the retail price, a link to a brand-new one, and the ceiling you have already blown past. |
| **Parts-only banner** | 💀 If the **lot's own** description says parts-only / broken / damaged / `Is Item Damaged? Yes`, a black-and-red banner goes above everything else, and **all retail comparison and bid advice is suppressed** — a working unit's price is not a valid comparison for a broken one. |
| **Fee provenance** | Every fee is shown with the exact sentence it was parsed from, so a wrong number is traceable instead of magic. |
| **Never blocks the page** | Two-pass rendering: everything derivable from the DOM appears instantly, the network lookup runs detached. A pulse loader in the top-right corner shows while it is in flight. |

### Nothing waits on the network

The lot page renders and stays interactive throughout. Enhancement happens in two
passes:

**Pass 1 — synchronous.** Condition banners, the parsed fee stack, the all-in cost
of the next bid, and provisional guidance from the auctioneer's own stated retail.
Rendered immediately from the DOM, no network involved.

**Pass 2 — detached.** The live retail lookup is fired *without* being awaited, so
the controller returns straight away. While it is in flight a 20px pulsing
gradient dot sits at `top: 25px; right: 25px`, and the provisional figures are
labelled *unverified* / *provisional*. When the quotes land, the retail row, bid
guidance and verdict banner re-render in place.

![Pulse loader](docs/screenshot-loader.png)

Concretely, on the reference lot with a deliberately slowed network:

| | Retail shown | Ceiling | Loader |
|---|---|---|---|
| **at 1.2s** | $328.00 — auctioneer's claim, `UNVERIFIED` | BID UP TO **$122.00** *(provisional)* | visible |
| **after lookup** | $278.00 at Amazon.ca, `NEW` | BID UP TO **$104.00** | hidden |

A generation counter drops stale results, so a slow lookup for a lot you have
already navigated away from can never overwrite the current one.

### The money

```
premium  = hammer × premium%
card     = (hammer + premium) × card%          (only if the terms mention one)
handling = per-item fee + large-item fee       (large-item only for appliances)
all-in   = (hammer + premium + card + handling) × (1 + tax%)

max hammer for a target discount d:
  budget  = retail × (1 − d)
  hammer  = (budget ÷ (1 + tax%) − handling) ÷ ((1 + premium%) × (1 + card%))
```

Worked through on the lot this was built against — Sony WF-1000XM5, retail
**C$278** on Amazon.ca, terms of *16% Buyer's Premium plus HST, $1.50 handling per
item*, Ontario 13% HST:

| Hammer | Premium | Handling | Tax | All-in | vs retail |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $31.00 | $4.96 | $1.50 | $5.02 | **$42.33** | 84.8% under |
| $104.00 | $16.64 | $1.50 | $15.87 | **$138.01** | 50.4% under ← the ceiling |
| $157.00 | $25.12 | $1.50 | $23.92 | **$207.54** | 25.3% under ← walk away |

So the script reports **BID UP TO $104.00** for a 50%-off deal, with a hard
walk-away at **$156.00**.

Tax is applied to the whole invoice (hammer + premium + fees), which is how
Ontario auctioneers bill it.

## Retail price sources

There is **no free official API for Amazon.ca prices** — Amazon's Product
Advertising API requires an approved affiliate account with qualifying sales,
CamelCamelCamel publishes no API, and Keepa is subscription-only. See
[docs/PRICING-SOURCES.md](docs/PRICING-SOURCES.md) for the full evaluation.

What the script uses instead, in priority order:

1. **Amazon.ca** — the search page, parsed in the browser via
   `GM_xmlhttpRequest`. No key. Sponsored placements are dropped, accessories are
   rejected, and the ASIN is captured so the CamelCamelCamel history link is
   exact.
2. **Best Buy Canada** — `bestbuy.ca/api/v2/json/search`, an undocumented but
   open, key-free JSON endpoint. Used as an independent cross-check.
3. **The auctioneer's own figure** — the `Retail $…` in the title, an
   `Est. Retail Price:` field, or the top of the Estimate range. Shown as
   *unverified*, and used only when nothing live could be found.
4. **Keepa** *(optional, paid)* — CamelCamelCamel-grade history behind an
   official API. Off by default; add a key in the settings menu to enable.

The cheapest **brand new** quote wins. Used and open-box quotes never set the
benchmark while a new price exists, because comparing an auction lot to a used
price hides how bad the deal is.

**No API keys or secrets are required for the default setup.** Nothing needs to
go in 1Password — see the note in [docs/PRICING-SOURCES.md](docs/PRICING-SOURCES.md).

### Why accessory filtering matters

`Spigen Rugged Armor Designed for Sony WF-1000XM5 Case` matches the brand *and*
the model perfectly and costs **$26.99**. Left unfiltered it becomes "retail",
the lot reads as *61% over* retail, and the recommended ceiling collapses to
**$9.00** — the exact opposite of the truth. Three independent signals reject it:

1. an explicit `for` / `designed for` / `compatible with` / `replacement for` marker,
2. a leading brand that differs from the product's brand (behind any `Open Box -` prefix),
3. an accessory noun positioned *before* the product identity — `Case for Sony WF-1000XM5`
   is an accessory, while `Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds with Charging Case` is not.

A lot that genuinely *is* an accessory skips all three, so cases and cables still
get priced.

## Install

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
2. **[→ Click here to install the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgomesbr/hibid-enhancer-suite/main/src/hibid-enhancer.user.js)** —
   Tampermonkey intercepts the `.user.js` URL and shows its install page.
3. Open any HiBid lot page.

Pinned to the tagged release instead of `main`:
[v0.1.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgomesbr/hibid-enhancer-suite/v0.1.0/src/hibid-enhancer.user.js).
Installing from `main` is recommended — `@updateURL` points there, so
Tampermonkey picks up new versions automatically.

Tampermonkey will ask to allow cross-origin requests to `amazon.ca` and
`bestbuy.ca` the first time. Both are needed for price lookups; deny them and the
script falls back to the auctioneer's stated retail.

## Settings

Tampermonkey's menu on a HiBid page:

- **settings** — target discount (default 50%), red-warning threshold
  (default 25%), fallback buyer's premium (default 18%), per-provider toggles,
  optional Keepa key.
- **clear price cache** — lookups are cached 12h per query.
- **re-run on this page** — clears the cache and re-renders.

The Keepa key is stored in Tampermonkey's own storage on your machine. It is
never sent anywhere except `api.keepa.com`.

## Tests

```bash
node test/run-tests.mjs            # 86 assertions, no dependencies

npm install --no-save linkedom     # provides DOMParser for Node
node test/run-provider-tests.mjs   # 29 assertions against real captured responses
```

`test/fixtures/` holds trimmed but otherwise untouched real responses from
Amazon.ca and Best Buy Canada, so a markup change at either retailer surfaces as
a test failure rather than a silently wrong price.

The suites cover the fee parser against five real auction fee wordings, the
round-trip property that `allIn(maxHammerFor(retail, d)) == d% under retail`
across prices and targets, bid-increment rounding, province tax detection,
parts-only detection, and every accessory/homonym trap found while building this.

## Page support

| Page | Status |
|---|---|
| Lot detail (`/lot/…`) | ✅ implemented |
| Search / lots (`/lots`, `/search`) | 🔜 registered in the router, not implemented |
| Auction catalog (`/auction/…`) | 🔜 registered in the router, not implemented |

New page types plug into the `PAGES` registry near the bottom of the script; the
fee engine, product extraction and price providers are page-agnostic and reusable
as-is.

## Notes and limits

- **Auction prices move constantly.** The script reads the bid at render time.
  Re-check before bidding.
- **Fees are parsed from free text.** HiBid's structured `buyerPremiumRate` is
  unreliable (it frequently reports 0% when the terms say 16%), so everything is
  text-driven with a conservative 18% fallback. Always expand *How these fees
  were determined* on a lot you're about to bid real money on.
- **Auction-wide boilerplate is deliberately ignored** for condition. Most
  liquidation auctions say "ALL ITEMS SOLD AS-IS, NOT TESTED" on every lot; a
  banner that fires every time is a banner you stop reading. Only the lot's own
  description, lead, and structured condition fields can trigger the parts-only
  warning.
- **This script never bids.** It reads and advises. Bidding is yours.
